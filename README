This respiratory builds an android application with the following activities and xml files, LogIn, RegisterRequest and Register. 

It first opens up and gives an opportunity to the user to log in if they have an existing account or to register if it doesn't. 

If the user doesn't have an existing account it sends a request to my domain with the PHP files that I have defined.
